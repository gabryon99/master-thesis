## Extending Kotlin with Algebraic Effect Handlers

This folder contains all the notes for the Master Thesis @ ([University of Pisa](https://di.unipi.it/), [TUM](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/)) + [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).

### Description

The work consists of trying to extend the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming language with **Algebraic Effect Handlers** (AEH).

AEH allow to model the control flow of a given program defining effects and how these should be handled. For instance, with algebraic effects
it is possible to define the Exception, Generator, Cooperative shecudling mechanisms.
